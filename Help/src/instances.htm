<h1>Instances</h1>
<p>
An instance refers to a single occurrence of items in the system tray. 
For each instance there will be an item in the system tray that provides visibility of files, folders, hyperlinks, and plugins as configured when right clicked.
Each instance behaves uniquely according to how the instance's options are configured.
