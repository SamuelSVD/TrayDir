<h1>Instances</h1>
<p>An instance refers to a single occurrence of items in the system tray. For each instance there will be a new item in the system tray that provides unique control, with separate, independent file, folder, and plugin links when right clicked. Each instance behaves uniquely according to how the instance's options are configured.
