<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>When you first open up TrayDir you are greeted with the default new instance. At the top you will find four buttons corresponding with the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New File: Inserts a new file menu item</li>
<li>New Folder: Inserts a new folder menu item</li>
<li>New WebLink: Inserts a new web link menu item</li>
<li>New Plugin: Inserts a new plugin menu item</li>
<li>New Virtual Folder: Inserts a new virtual folder menu item</li>
<li>New Separator: Inserts a separator item that displays as a horizontal bar</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the System Tray?</h2>
<p>The system tray is the list of items at the bottom right of your windows task bar. In most cases, this is where the time, date, Wi-Fi connection, and other settings are displayed.</p>
<h2>Modifying TrayDir</h2>
<p>You can modify TrayDir and add corresponding links by clicking on New File at the top. This will result in a new file item being added to the list of items, and begins browsing for a file in your file system. When you select a file, this file will appear in the righ-click menu of TrayDir in the System Tray</p>
<p>If you hover over the TrayDir icon in the system tray, you will notice that it is named "New Instance". This name can be modified by clicking on the top menu, <code>Instance > Edit Name</code>.</p>
<p>If you right click on the TrayDir icon in the system tray, you will be greeted by the Tray Menu, containing the file item that you added to the list. When clicked, this file will be opened as if you had selected it directly through a File Explorer window.</p>
<h2>Adding New Instances</h2>
<p>In case you want a new icon in the system tray for a separate set of items, either click on the <code>+</code> beside the New Instance name or click on the menu <code>Instance > New</code>. From here you should be able to select the new instance in a new named tab near the top of the form, and see the new icon in the system tray.</p>
